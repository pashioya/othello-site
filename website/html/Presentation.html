                    I.Our CSR Responsibility – Stakeholder interaction
                </h1>
                <h4> Social Environmental measures </h4>
                <p>
                    After considering recent events shedding light on certain social inequalities, Team9 pledged to promote and maintain a diverse well-informed workforce. Although only a year old, Team9 was fortunate enough to thrive during the turbulent economic environment of the global pandemic, and our new CSR initiatives reflect this growth. Our employees have access to new services, including online counselling, online fitness lessons, and a flexible work schedule that allows extra time for their emotional and physical well-being. To promote employee growth, we also opted to provide a wide range of virtual learning and ethics courses, including Social Diversity courses focusing on Equity and inclusion principles.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Team9 seeks to be adaptable and flexible in response to global events, particularly considering the unprecedented occurrences of the last several years. In reaction to the Covid outbreak, we swiftly set up workstations in our employee's homes. When corona lockdowns arrived, we were nearly wholly untouched by them. Furthermore, we were able to maintain our actual office space as modest and energy-efficient as possible, decreasing our environmental effect and supporting global stewardship.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Environmental Economic  measures
                </h4> 
                <p>
                    Team9 has put forth several initiatives that push the company towards carbon neutrality and financial sustainability. As previously mentioned, our move to home offices allowed us to drastically reduce our physical office space and the rent expenditure that came with it. We realised going beyond the environmental compliance regulations can bring economic benefits. For example, to reduce the amount of waste we produced, Team9 opted for online-only distributors for our games. By having Othello available on only our website and other select online stores, we stop unnecessary use of natural resources in the form of manufacturing physical copies of a game that could be sold online. Of course, this has the benefit of lowering our manufacturing costs to near zero further improving our profit margins.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    II.	Our CSR Methodology - Sustainability
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our CSR methodology is based on long-term sustainability. Our business strategy is based on equity, and our free-to-play model welcomes individuals from all walks of life, regardless of social class. Furthermore, we intend to place advertisements in strategic locations on both the website and in-game to avoid detracting from the gaming experience while staying financially sustainable. Finally, we intend to solicit donations from willing gamers to maintain reasonable profit margins.
                </p>

                    III.	Benefits of Our CSR Program
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our CSR focuses on our social contract with all stakeholders, striving to create an ideal relationship that benefits the majority while fostering a more favourable reputation and overall brand recognition. This leads to a larger player base and general player loyalty, which increases our ad income. Our initiatives to lower our carbon footprint decreased our operational costs and increased our adaptability to global changes. Our efforts to foster healthy employee mental and physical wellness have resulted in a greater ability to attract and retain talent.
